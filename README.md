# cpp basics
why we do what we do is a complicated thing and this is one of those instances where I'm learning a language not because I like it but because of enforcement and sheer abundance.

this repo culminates most of my work regarding getting started with cpp and learning the foundational concepts regarding data structures and algorithms.
I prefer to use the latest versions in my work so there will be modifications to traditional functions because of deprecations or just because I found a better way.

Keep an open mind. Keep learning ðŸ¥‚
